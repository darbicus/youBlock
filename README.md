# youBlock
a chrome extension to block youtube spammers in the live stream chat.


This extension is to allow users to block certain users in the YouTube streaming chat. To block a user simply flag them for spam.
This is a feature for YouTube streaming videos chat. When there are a bunch of spammers and flagging them for spam doesn't seem to be doing anything. All you have to do is install this refresh the streaming page and then flag them for spam once and they will no longer show up in your chat.

The filter only works until you refresh the page currently. This is still in testing at the moment but more features will be added like:
remembering spammers,
ability to remove spammers (currently you can just refresh the page to remove all filters but then you will get all the spammers messages until you block them again),
filter all older spammer messages when blocked
